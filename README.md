# PrivacyGram - A Privacy-Focused Instagram Client  

🔒 **Respects your privacy** | 🎨 **Custom themes** | ⬇️ **Media download**  

PrivacyGram is an open-source, privacy-conscious alternative Instagram client that puts you in control of your data.  

## Key Features  
- **Zero Tracking**: No analytics, no ads, no data collection  
- **Secure Authentication**: Minimal permissions requested  
- **Download Any Media**: Save photos/videos with one click  
- **Customizable UI**: Light/Dark/AMOLED themes  
- **Transparent**: Clear privacy policy and data usage  

## Why PrivacyGram?  
Unlike official clients, PrivacyGram:  
- Doesn't track your activity  
- Requests only essential permissions  
- Stores data locally whenever possible  
- Provides full media control  

Built with React, Material-UI, and Instagram's official API.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is an unofficial client. Use complies with Instagram's Terms of Service.  

# To deploy this application:

1. Set up a Node.js server or use a platform like Vercel/Netlify
2. Configure environment variables
3. Build the React app (`npm run build`)
4. Serve the build folder

# Note:

⚠ **Warning**: Due to Instagram API restrictions, this works best as:
- A personal educational project
- A template for approved business/creator accounts
- A reference for privacy-focused UI patterns

## Functional But Limited
✅ Actual Instagram API integration  
✅ Real OAuth2 login flow  
✅ Working media downloader  

## Production Realities
🛑 Requires Facebook Developer approval  
🛑 Only works with approved business accounts  
🛑 Personal accounts get restricted quickly  

## How Developers Can Use This
1. Study the privacy-focused architecture
2. Adapt for approved use cases (e.g. brand tools)
3. Learn secure auth patterns
